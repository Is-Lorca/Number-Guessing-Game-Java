# Number Guessing Game (Java) 🎯

A simple console-based **Number Guessing Game** written in Java.  
This project was created to practice core Java concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, user input, and control flow.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java
- `Scanner` class for user input
- `Random` class for number generation
- Console output with `System.out.printf`

---

## 📚 Project Purpose

This project was developed to practice and reinforce:

- Programming logic
- Java syntax and structure
- Loops (`do/while`)
- Conditional statements (`if/else`, `switch`)
- User input handling
- Random number generation
- Creating Methods 
- Basic game flow control

It is part of my personal portfolio and represents my progress in learning Java.

## ▶️ How It Works

1. The program displays a welcome message and explains the game rules.
2. The user chooses a difficulty level:
   - Easy
   - Medium
   - Hard
3. Based on the chosen level:
   - A random number is generated.
   - The user receives a limited number of attempts.
4. The user tries to guess the number.
5. After each incorrect guess, a hint is shown:
   - The number is higher or lower.
6. The game ends when:
   - The user guesses correctly, or
   - The attempts run out.
7. The user can choose to play again or exit.

## 📌 Features

- Three difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: numbers between 0–10 (5 attempts)
  - **Medium**: numbers between 0–30 (15 attempts)
  - **Hard**: numbers between 0–50 (25 attempts)
- Input validation for difficulty selection
- Hints after wrong guesses
- Attempt counter
- Option to replay the game

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Compile the program:
    ```
    javac Main.java
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```
    java Main
    ```

## 📝 Notes

This project focuses on clarity and logic rather than advanced Java features.  
It was intentionally kept simple to strengthen fundamental concepts.

Possibly in the future I will be able to update it with more mechanics and more dynamic and better-structured code.
